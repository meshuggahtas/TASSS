## Rerecording
- Records @ [TASVideos.org MovieStatistics] (https://tasvideos.org/MovieStatistics)
- Number of times the TASer went back to an earlier frame and changed input
- Statistic is freely editable
- Factors affecting this value making comparisons unreliable:
  - Different emulators with different ways to recognize rerecording
  - Different TASing creation like using TAS Editor or TAStudio over classic savestate loadstate TASing
  - Different games where order of events affects final time like freely selectable levels and games where more events changes the outcome over a lesser RNG based games
  - Usage of automation using Lua scripts / Basic Bot
  - Emulator bug
  - TASer mistake
  - Resetting it to 0 after copy-pasting input into a new file
