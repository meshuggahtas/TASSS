A Tool-Assisted Speedrun (TAS) is a file containing [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) and a sequence of [inputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_(computer_science)). The goal is to create the theoretically perfect playthrough which completes a [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) as fast as possible.

The input sequence is created in an [emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator) using tools such as savestates , frame-by-frame advance for [slow motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_motion), memory watch

The idea is not to make gameplay easier for players, but rather to produce a playthrough at a level of gameplay impractical for a human player. As such, rather than being a branch of e-sports focused on practical achievements, tool-assisted speedrunning concerns itself with research into the theoretical limits of the games and their respective competition categories, and producing content with an emphasis on entertainment value — such as by including tricks and stunts that would otherwise be prohibitively difficult to incorporate.

The idea is to produce a demonstration of gameplay that would be practically impossible for a human player.
