TASing anything other than a video game

# Potential problems

## Inability to submit
Ask rule makers if an exception can be allowed for a proof of concept / demonstration movie when the same thing couldn’t be done on the accepted emulator versions in the forseeable future.

Famous video games like Half-Life, Doom, even Super Mario Galaxy has TASes that currently doesn’t fits to the rules of tasvideos.org or probably any other universal TASing community, but this doesn’t means they shouldn’t give them the opportunity to present their content and allow them to submit and improve upon each technological leap in accuracy of emulator and level of TASing gameplay.
