List of Recommended Movies Featuring Tool-Assisted Speedrunning Aspects Directly or Indirectly

# Recommendations
- Watch together with friends
- Watch it where you are able to pause and rewind in order to discuss events and share opinions
  - a note about how to interpret the media to make it a learnable material
  - a note about information credibility and validity

# Notes
- Media in this list is selected based on objective properties and filtered down subjectively.
  - Since speedrunning phenomena shares a lot of sciences, I tried to both have enough selection to choose from and give ideas for the reader to find similar content
  - No , no rottentomatoes and other online reviews. this list is not a "must watch movies" or "top 10 best tasing related movies". if you are interested in other's reactions/analysis, google it yourself. Otherwise it might influence you to avoid watching that based on someone else probably subjective and maybe objective facts and opinions.
