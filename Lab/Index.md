# Notes

- Priorities and requirements on this page for...
  - Software: Free and Open-Source, Paid
  - Hardware: Unique features. This is about required and suggested hardware product categories, not an actual single product.
  - Guides for bigger categories like Security: Non paywalled article showing multiple choices without bias (no corporate pages with hidden advertisements)

# TODO
- grammar and content guideline: write neutrally and focus on given actions instead of ordering
- Relevant topics to (consider and decide to) include on this page:
  - Troubleshooting PC
  - Human Factor in Ergonomics + Physical Customization:
  - do it yourself overhead panels and battlestations

- add more alternatives
