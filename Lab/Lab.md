# Notes

- Priorities and requirements on this page for...

  - Software: Free and Open-Source, Paid

  - Hardware: Unique features. This is about required and suggested hardware product categories, not an actual single product.

  - Guides for bigger categories like Security: Non paywalled article showing multiple choices without bias (no corporate pages with hidden advertisements)



# TODO

- grammar and content guideline: write neutrally and focus on given actions instead of ordering

- Relevant topics to (consider and decide to) include on this page:

  - Troubleshooting PC

  - Human Factor in Ergonomics + Physical Customization:

  - do it yourself overhead panels and battlestations

  - requires health warning!!# 

- add more alternatives
